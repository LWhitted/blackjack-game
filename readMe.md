I can say before starting this project I was extremely confused about the dom etc. but now I have a better grasp on the material! It is cool to see the code you've created in play. I like the puzzle nature of javascript. 

For this assignment I didn't do the extra credit items because I ran out of time.
*My note for later: Bounus Items*
Create a way to play the game with 3 decks of cards (156 cards) or six deck of cards (312 cards)
Use an animation to reveal a card when it is drawn.
Hide dealer's hole card, and reveal it before dealer's turn.
Keep track of wins vs losses.
Add betting structure instead of wins vs losses. The player with start out with a certain amount of money - say $500. There will be a minimum bet of $5. The player can choose an amount to bet before each hand.

One tiny bug I couldn't work out was the hidden dealer card and a slight glitch when there is a tie
